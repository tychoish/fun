# fun -- Go Generic Functions and Tools

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/tychoish/fun.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tychoish/fun)

``fun`` is a simple, well tested, zero-dependency, package of generic function, tools and
patterns, and the kind of thing you *could* write one-offs for but shouldn't.

For more information, see the documentation, but of general interest:

- Iterators.
- A channel-based message broker (for one-to-many channel patterns).
- An error collector implementation for threadsafe error aggregation.
- A set type and associated tools.
- A burstable load-shedding queue.

Contributions welcome, the general goals of the project:

- superior API ergonomics.
- great high-level abstractions.
- obvious and clear implementations.

Have fun!
